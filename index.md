# Jamie's Blog
This blog is a place for me to write up interesting articles about things, mostly programming related, but probably also quite wide ranging. I am in definite need of somewhere to paste and share ideas that have no other home so they'll all end up here.

## About
I am Jamie. I am predominantly a C# developer but also have extensive experience with other languages such as Java, Python, and C. I write [DarkRiftNetworking](http://www.darkriftnetworking.com) and spend most of my free time doing things related to that but am also a keen gamer on Overwatch, PUBG, Civillization, and many others.

## Contact
Feel free to contact me via my [DarkRift email](jamie@darkriftnetworking.com) if you need anything.
