# Jamie Read

I'm a DevOps engineer with a love of automating manual processes and improving the efficiency of teams. I specialise in CI/CD and Kubernetes but have a long background of software engineering across a number of disciplines.

I'm currently with [AND Digital](https://and.digital), working with organisations to deliver amazing software and help them upskill in DevOps, Agile and cloud computing. I used to work for [Cirium](https://www.cirium.com) as an SRE where I maintained Kubernetes platforms and generally kept the office lights on.

Over the years I've built everything from networking libraries for multiplayer games (ever played [Among Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/)?) to turbulence tracking apps used in the cockpits of hundreds of planes.
