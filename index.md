# Jamie Read
I'm a DevOps engineer with a love of automating manual processes and improving the efficiency of teams. I specialise in CI/CD and Kubernetes but have a long background of software engineering across a number of disciplines.

I'm currently with AND Digital, working with organisations to deliver amazing software and help them upskill in DevOps, Agile and cloud computing. I used to work for Cirium as an SRE where I maintained the Kubernetes platform and generally kept the office lights on.

Over the years I've built everything from multiplayer game networking libraries (ever played Among Us?) to apps used in the cockpits of planes. Check out some of the [stuff I've worked on](projects.md).
