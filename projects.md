# Projects
## DarkRift Networking
[DarkRift Networking](https://www.darkriftnetworking.com/) is a high performance, multithreaded networking system for Unity designed for speed and flexibility.

Originally a project I started while I was still in sixth form it grew to be one of the top five networking systems for Unity and was acquired by [Unordinal](https://unordinal.com/) in 2022 and [open sourced](https://github.com/DarkRiftNetworking/DarkRift) as part of their product family.

## Hazel Networking
Designed as the foundation for DarkRift 2, [Hazel](https://github.com/DarkRiftNetworking/Hazel-Networking) was a low level networking library that handled reliable UDP communication, also supporting ordered messages and fragmentation. While it never made it into DarkRift 2's final codebase it did get [forked](https://github.com/willardf/Hazel-Networking) and used as the networking library for the multi-award winning game [Among Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us).

## Fast Object Filter & Fast String Format
These two projects were also originally designed for use in DarkRift to provided incredibly fast filtering of messages going through the servers for logging, forwarding etc. [Both](https://github.com/JamJar00/fast-object-filter) [projects](https://github.com/JamJar00/fast-string-format) make extensive used of .NET expressions and provide [near raw .NET levels of performance](https://github.com/JamJar00/fast-string-format#current-benchmarks) while being completely runtime configurable. Definitely two projects I'd like to revisit!

## Japr
[Jamie's Awesome Project Rater](https://github.com/JamJar00/japr) is a language-agnostic tool that rates and lints projects by looking at the project's tooling and language setup. It checks things like the content of your readme, whether you've get a linter installed and that you've setup git well. It's a hard linter to satisfy, but your projects will be all the better for it!

## restdir
[A simple project to serve a directory.](https://github.com/JamJar00/restdir) This is something I've needed a few times and was always a little sad there wasn't a simple and lightweight tool for it. I can't say I've actually used it since writing it, but at least I know I have it now!

## SpanishDict Shortcut
While practising my Spanish I regularly find myself looking up words by copying them, opening up [SpanishDict.com](https://spanishdict.com), pasting them and hitting enter. In search of an afternoon's entertainment and a few less clicks [I wrote my first Firefox add-on](https://github.com/JamJar00/spanishdict-shortcut) to add a simple button in the context menu that gets you straight to your highlighted word's definition and translation. You can even install it yourself [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/spanishdict-shortcut/)!
